# Parabellum-War-Trophy
A Parabellum Extension


  Again, first thing first I would like to thank all the modder of Hardcore SK and modders who create mods for it, who showed me a brand new Rimworld experience and introduce me to the world of modding for Rimworld(Mainy HSK).

   **Si vis Pacem, para bellum - If you want peace, prepare for war**

This is an extension of Parabellum Mod, the mod add any military hardware that I find fun/interesting to play with, can be something to explore CE limits or something that add challenge and variety for HSK combat.

[RUS - переводчик]


   **Si vis Pacem, para bellum - Хочешь мира, готовься к войне**

Это расширение мода Parabellum, мод добавляет любую военную технику, с которой мне весело/интересно играть, может быть чем-то, чтобы исследовать ограничения CE или что-то, что добавляет сложности и разнообразия в бою HSK.

Этот перевод не очень точен, извините

## EXTRA NOTES:

**¿BASE GAME SUPPORT?**

*Sigh...* Unlikely, since I lost my interest for the basegame, is just depressing about how Tynan and the RW community modding work


I do speak and write English, Spanish and Chinese(not traditional, atleast not writing it), the thing is, I never mastered any of those language so typo is expected, and English is not my main language, I am just fortunate to learn it when I was young, and sadly I don't speak Russian, I can't interact with the russian server of HSK due that reason 

Any issue(either balance or bug) or suggestion report it to me please!

Also Sorry, I am a newbie using GitHub, I really need some advise of how it works

Any support can help me, if you like donation, here is my Ko-fi link: https://ko-fi.com/xxnelsonxx78863

I am also open to Rimworld Mod commission, my speciality are XML modding and making texture, just DM me in Discord if you are interested

Note: any asset from this mod is created by me, some of them use HSK community and recently Dub's Rimatomic effects, stealing and distributing the mod and its asset in other place without permission is forbidden, and a disrespect for the community and people that work for it, **DON'T DO THAT**

**THANKS FOR USING THE MOD :D**
